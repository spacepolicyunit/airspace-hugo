## Background

The People’s Republic of China (China) released its Space Launch Guidelines on 10 June 2019 under the purview of its State Administration of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND). They outline China’s motivations: to enhance the country’s spacefaring capabilities and boost their competitiveness in the international launch market. Primarily, they contain instructions for companies that plan to or are currently operating in the industry, including the area of weaponry research. These include applying for two separate licenses to conduct scientific research and production respectively, setting up internal confidentiality management systems in companies, as well as seeking permits to conduct space launch activities1.

Since these guidelines were directed at domestic companies and hence, they lack official English translations. Unless one either reads the native language or relies on a third party’s interpretation, one may find such legal texts inaccessible. The Export Control Law of the People’s Republic of China (ECL) taking effect on 1 December 2020 poses further implications for foreign firms intending to collaborate with domestic Chinese companies.2 Therefore, this brief serves to introduce both the Space Launch Guidelines and the ECL, before detailing what foreign companies ought to look out for and the future steps they can consider taking. It focuses specifically on navigating export control regulations and confidentiality clauses in the context of the space launch industry.

## Navigating Export Control Regulations on Missiles and Related Technology

China’s regulation of missile exports for military use shapes their policy on the export of launch vehicles and their related technologies. From their perspective, missiles comprise rockets and the technology behind them, and technology refers to any specialised knowledge required for developing, producing and using the items. Such knowledge can be imparted from entity to entity through technical data transfers or technical assistance.

A military product includes: missiles capable of throwing payloads of more than 500kg or to more than 300km, and production facilities specially designed for them and their related items. Hence, exporting them requires SASTIND’s approval beforehand. A foreign company looking to use Chinese launch vehicles that meet the above criteria ought to ensure the Chinese entity has submitted the relevant documents and materials prior to signing an export contract with them. A more detailed exposition on these requirements and the relevant process is furnished below.

## Navigating Export Control Regulations on Satellites and Related Technology

Satellite manufacturers formed 29 out of the 78 domestic companies highlighted by the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) in 2019, and are thus another significant sector of the Chinese commercial space industry. Foreign firms intending to collaborate with them may wish to take note of how ECL has tightened restrictions for such collaborations.

One significant effect of the ECL is that it has updated China’s control list, formally called the

Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited or Restricted by China from Export. The table below outlines prohibited and restricted items commonly associated with satellite and missile technology:3

## Implications of ECL

While there has been no public reports of legal action taken against companies yet, foreign firms could go beyond checking their imported products against the above control list by taking into consideration the below:

Firstly, foreign firms should ensure the Chinese entities they are collaborating with, termed “export operators”, comply with the ECL. Export operators must submit an application to the State Export Control Administrative Department (SECAD), which would review it based on the criteria listed in Article 13 of the ECL. One of the criteria is “end-users and end use”: SECAD expects to be informed of exactly who the end-users are, so if a foreign firm engages in re-exports to a third entity, this entity is who ought to be listed as an end-user.

This also means it is part of the foreign firm’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with an export operator’s application procedure. It comes in two main phases:

![](/images/brief-flowchart.png)

The first phase is concerned with gaining approval to acquire a license for technology exports. Firms must file an application to the relevant foreign trade department under the State Council, after which the department (along with the science and technology administrative department) will examine it and provide a resolution on approval or disapproval within 30 working days. The competent foreign trade department shall then issue a letter of intent for licensing if the application is approved, and the applicant can then establish a contract for the export.

Following this is the procedure to attain the actual license. The applicant must submit the letter of intent, a copy of the contract established, details of the technical information being transferred in the export and any other document ascertaining the legal status of the parties involved to the competent foreign trade department under the State Council. The department will then examine the application and the legitimacy of the export contract, and shall make a decision to approve or disapprove within 15 working days of the documents received. An export license shall then be issued in the event the application is approved.4

It is not yet clear who constitutes “export operators” and what proportion of a controlled or restricted item within the final exported product would cause the latter to be considered a “re-export”. Therefore, it would be prudent for foreign firms to look out for future clarifications, as well as reevaluate the opportunity costs of pursuing a collaboration with the Chinese firm, in the event that obtaining permits becomes arduous.

Lastly, while the ECL laid out clear penalties for non-compliant Chinese exporters, it has not done so for foreign companies. The consequences of either attempting to exploit the laws or refusing to comply with them are less clear for such firms.

Article 48 indicates China would take “reciprocal action” against countries or regions that abuse the ECL to endanger China’s national security and interests, but what these reciprocal actions are are undefined, and instead, are “based on the actual situation”. Keeping abreast of the relationships between China and other countries would thus be helpful in this situation.

A more immediate concern to a foreign firm might be to ensure they do not end up on the blacklist system seemingly established by the ECL - one similar to the Export Administration Regulations’ (EAR) entity list. An end user of a restricted Chinese product must commit to neither changing its end use nor transferring it to a third party. Breaking this commitment, “potentially endangering national security” or using the controlled item for “terrorism purposes” as defined by China could land the foreign firm in this blacklist. While penalties would not befall them, Chinese export operators would be the ones facing these penalties should they conduct transactions with these firms. Even if the Chinese export operator were to try to obtain a licence to conduct business with such a foreign firm, this licence would have to be applied by the domestic company; the foreign entity would have no power in this regard.5 6

## Examining Confidentiality Clauses of Launch Guidelines

Chinese commercial rocket companies are encouraged to sign “contracts for commission and confidentiality agreements” with state-owned enterprises and the military industry for access to scientific research and production activities, according to Clause 17 of the launch guidelines. This means that China will retain an interest in the enforcement of contracts formed between the Chinese commercial rocket company and foreign entities that choose to contract with it. In the case of a contract for commission, a Chinese company would undertake to act as a “trustee” of the SOE or military industry, and a foreign entity would be dealing with the Chinese company as a third party.

In addition, Chinese companies that have signed confidentiality agreements might undertake not to transfer confidential information to third parties. If breached by the Chinese company, persons who have transferred or received the information might be subject to criminal sanctions.
